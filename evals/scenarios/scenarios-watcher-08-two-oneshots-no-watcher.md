# Mixing `kiss test-watch` with `kiss test`

One `kiss test-watch` process stays up in a worktree. It takes no options and no TARGET. A later `kiss test` contacts it, echoes the reply, and exits. The watcher does not exit when that later command finishes.

"Return" means the watcher replies. It does not mean the watch process exits.

Where this file disagrees with VISION.md, follow this file. VISION.md still treats bare `kiss test` as `kiss test .`, and it still calls the watcher `kiss test --watch`. From a subdirectory, bare `kiss test` covers the whole repository and `kiss test .` covers only that subdirectory. The watcher command is `kiss test-watch`.

Unless a scenario names a different code, the process exits with:

- 0 when every test in scope passed and there was no operational failure
- 1 when any test in scope is FAIL or TIMEOUT and there was no operational failure
- 255 on an operational failure, including a failure to reach the watcher that the command does not recover from by running the tests itself
- 2 on a usage error

Test lines are the same whether or not a watcher is running. They list every FAIL in scope and every TIMEOUT in scope, whether that result was just produced or read from the cache. They also list every test that ran for that request. A cached PASS that did not run has no line of its own. The summary counts every PASS, FAIL, and TIMEOUT in scope. Doctests are never in scope. Messages that only describe contact with the watcher, such as a waiting line, may differ. The exit codes above apply in either case.

A command that is waiting in order to proceed repeats its waiting message every 3 seconds. While `kiss test-watch` is idle and waiting for a connection, it does not repeat a waiting message.

The watcher runs tests on its own cycles: a startup cycle, a cycle after edits settle, and a cycle once it has noticed that a config file changed. A plain client does not start a cycle and does not make the watcher run tests. The watcher answers a client only while it is waiting, from the cache, for that client's scope. It finishes the cycle it is running before it answers a waiting client. A client that arrives during a cycle waits until the watcher is waiting. The in-flight cycle is not filtered or narrowed for that client, and the answer does not include a cycle that has not started. `kiss test --retry-bad` is the exception: when that client is answered, the watcher runs the FAIL and TIMEOUT tests compatible with the client's TARGET. A client interrupted while it is only waiting is dropped. The watcher does not start a cycle for it.

## 8. Two `kiss test` commands with no watcher

User actions: Make sure no `kiss test-watch` is running. Edit source so that some tests need to run. In one terminal, run `kiss test`. While it is still running tests, run `kiss test` (or `kiss test PATH`) in a second terminal.

Correct behavior: The two processes lock each other out. They never run tests against the same cache at the same time. The second command prints `kiss test: waiting for kiss test` and repeats that line every 3 seconds until it can take the lock. When the first command finishes, it prints its results and exits. The second command then runs the usual workflow. Because the first command has just recorded its results, the second reruns only what is still needed. For a bare `kiss test` with no further edits, that is nothing: cached FAIL and TIMEOUT tests are not run again. It prints its results and exits. Neither command corrupts the cache. A third `kiss test` afterward reports the same PASS, FAIL, and TIMEOUT results and runs nothing. These plain runs use the same test lines as a reply from the watcher.
